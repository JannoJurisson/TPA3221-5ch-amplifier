# TPA3221-5ch-amplifier
A D-class car amplifier based on TPA3221, replaces BOSE 294009 car amplifier PCB.

The amplifier uses a Push-pull SMPS with a SG3525 controller to boost 12V to 24V. Transformer is hand-made using non-gapped ferrite transformer core TDK E-50.
Similar E cores can be used as the transformer is fastened to the pcb using cable ties 

There a 5 channels:
Channel 1-4 -> speaker outputs (@ 4ohm speakers > ~4x60W)
Channel 5   -> subwoofer output (TPA3221 in PBTL operation, @ 4ohm woofer > ~100w)
